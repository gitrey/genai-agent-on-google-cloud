## Overview 
{#overview-2}

<img src="images/adk-overview.png" width="600">

The Agent Development Kit ([ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)) is a flexible and modular framework designed for the development and deployment of AI agents. It aims to bring software development best practices to the creation of agentic architectures, facilitating the building, deploying, and orchestrating of simple to complex workflows. Although optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, the ADK is model-agnostic, deployment-agnostic, and compatible with other frameworks.

## ADK Agents 
{#adk-agents}

ADK offers various agent types designed to facilitate the creation of advanced applications. These categories provide a structured approach to development, enabling builders to leverage specific functionalities tailored to different GenAI use cases. Understanding these distinct categories is crucial for effectively utilizing the ADK to construct sophisticated and targeted solutions.  

<img src="images/19_.png" width="800">

## Using different LLM models with ADK 
{#using-different-llm-models-with-adk}

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is designed for flexibility, allowing you to integrate various Large Language Models (LLMs) into your agents. 

Here are some of the options for LLM models that ADK can use:

* Using Google Gemini Models  
* Using Anthropic models  
* Using Cloud & Proprietary Models via LiteLLM  
* Using Open & Local Models via LiteLLM  
* Self-Hosted Endpoint (e.g., vLLM)  
* Using Hosted & Tuned Models on Vertex AI  
* Third-Party Models on Vertex AI (e.g., Anthropic Claude)  
* etc

## ADK Tools 
{#adk-tools}

Within the Agent Development Kit (ADK), a Tool equips AI agents with specific functionalities, allowing them to act and engage with the external world, going beyond standard text generation and logical reasoning. The effective utilization of tools is a key differentiator between advanced agents and fundamental language models.

From a technical perspective, a tool is usually a self-contained piece of code, such as a Python or Java function, a class method, or even another specialized agent. These tools are built to perform specific, predetermined tasks, frequently involving interactions with external systems or data sources.

<img src="images/20_.png" width="800">

Tools perform specific actions, such as:

* Querying databases  
* Making API requests (e.g., fetching weather data, booking systems)  
* Searching the web  
* Executing code snippets  
* Retrieving information from documents (RAG)  
* Interacting with other software or services

## ADK MCP support 
{#adk-mcp-support}

ADK helps you both use and consume MCP tools in your agents, whether you're trying to build a tool to call an MCP service, or exposing an MCP server for other developers or agents to interact with your tools.

Here are couple of examples:

**ADK Agent and FastMCP** server deployed on Cloud Run with authentication enabled integration: [https://github.com/gitrey/adk-fastmcp](https://github.com/gitrey/adk-fastmcp) 

**MCP Toolbox for Databases** is an [open source](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox) MCP server that helps you build Gen AI tools so that your agents can access data in your database. Google‚Äôs Agent Development Kit (ADK) has built in support for The MCP Toolbox for Databases.
